# Something About Selenium and Emails
## What is this supposed to do?
It runs a script that sends a motivational email to your email address. Well, my email address for now.
## Why would I want that?
You probably wouldn't; I don't know.
## How do I set this up?
Clone the project, then add a file called 'EmailAddressContainer.java' into the same folder as the main method. Add the following to the file:
```java
    package com.notsparta.crss;
    
    public class EmailAddressContainer {
        public static String emailAddress = "";
    }
```
(Type an email address in between the quotation marks.)
